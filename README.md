# CalculatorApp

<h1>BACK TO BASICS</h1>

<p>This calculator was made as a WPF application. It performs basic functions and has some glaring limitations. I’ve dabbled with WPF before but have never really put my full focus on learning and getting familiar with all of the intricacies that this sort of application possesses. This app will be my starting point on my journey to learn WPF and to become job ready.</p>

<h1>ABOUT THE CALCULATOR</h1>

<p>The calculator can perform the basic operation of math and includes small features like a percentage button and negative button. The display is limited to 8-digits and will throw an error message if a result possesses a number greater than this digit cap. </p>

<p>I’ve also removed the default window modifiers that come with a WPF app on start-up. You can only minimize the window and close it.</p>

<h1>SETUP</h1>

<p>Most of the structure of the app is within the MainWindow.xaml file. The styling is in the App.xaml file. I decided to separate the button styling into separate files that can be found in the Theme folder. There is some styling within the App.xaml file but that is mostly global styling that is often overridden by the custom styling themes for the buttons.</p>

<p>I went with a dark color scheme because I find it easier on the eyes and its how I enjoy using all of my apps.</p>

<h1>IN CONCLUSION</h1>

<p>This was simply an exercise in WPF. I may or may not return to this app, to improve upon it, in the future. It is my hope that I can return to this as a better and more experienced developer. For now, I will continue on learning what I can.</p>
